# Tutorial: Analysis of Multiplex Social Networks with R (hands-on)

## Requirements

To participate in this tutorial you only need R and the library "multinet" installed. You can install it typing:

install.packages("multinet")

in your R console. As long as you can load the library, typing:

library(multinet)

you are ready to go!

## Useful additional resources

The following is some additional information that you might find useful during or after the tutorial.

- We recommend having RStudio installed - in general, not just for this tutorial.

- The following libraries can be useful to generate some nicer plots and results. They can be installed in a few minutes by typing this code into your R console:

install.packages("multinet")
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("pander")
install.packages("gplots")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("tibble")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("rprojroot")
install.packages("formatR")
install.packages("corrplot")

## Workshop material

The file workshop.Rmd can be opened with RStudio, so you have all the code there for your future reference. The file workshop.pdf is generated starting from the workshop.Rmd file and the libraries mentioned above - just click on Knit in the RStudio menu and choose the output (PDF, word, HTML). You can also execute individual parts of the document and play with the code.

Slides are available in workshop.pptx
