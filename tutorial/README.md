# Tutorial: Analysis of Multiplex Social Networks with R (hands-on)

## Requirements

To participate in this tutorial you only need R and the library "multinet" installed. You can install it typing:

install.packages("multinet")

in your R console. As long as you can load the library, typing:

library(multinet)

you are ready to go!

## Additional resources

Slides used during the tutorial are available in workshop.pptx.

The file workshop.Rmd can be opened with RStudio, so you have all the code there for your future reference. You can also execute individual parts of the document and modify the code.

The following libraries are used in workshop.Rmd to generate some nicer plots and results. They can be installed by typing this code into your R console:

install.packages("multinet")

install.packages("knitr")

install.packages("pander")

install.packages("gplots")

install.packages("ggplot2")

install.packages("tibble")

install.packages("rmarkdown")

install.packages("rprojroot")

install.packages("formatR")

install.packages("corrplot")

You can generate the file workshop.pdf starting from the workshop.Rmd file - just click on Knit in the RStudio menu and choose the output (PDF, word, HTML).
